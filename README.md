<h1>ZOMBIE VS CRAFTER RUN<h1> 

<h3> Description </h3> 

<p>
This is a MineCraft themed sort of pixel game, it is going to be a battle between a zombie and a crafter. This game will be based on the game Minecraft but on a survival mode, as if when the zombie attacks or collides with the crafter it loses health. But the twist is that the goal of the crafter is to reach the end point without it dying, so it is like a “race”. The game will end as soon as it's health level of the crafter reaches 0. We will try to make the background scroll as if the crafter is walking or maybe try to incorporate an animation of a background. Therefore, this is a side scroller game.The crafter will look like it is running and it will be able to jump.Throughout the way there  will be creature images (spiders) so that the crafter would be able to jump over them to avoid losing its health. However, if it fails to jump over them and he collides with the image, he would lose health. The crafter would be able to gain health if it collides with an image of meat. Now, we have an idea of having different keys for playing this game. We would want to incorporate that the zombie would run behind the crafter. We are planning on doing this by moving him with the keys (A-left, W-up, D-right, and S-down). While the crafter moves with the arrow keys (^-up, <-left, >-right). The zombie will also have a health to make the game more challenging. So if  the zombie collides with a zombie spider it would lose health. To gain health the zombie would have to collide with an image of a brain or the crafter. Our zombie was already created from scratch and we are planning to do the same with our crafter and other things we like the background. Now we are trying to make the game that after a certain amount of time you have been running either the zombie or the crafter wins.We are still deciding on our concept of the game, but this is what we have developed so far.
